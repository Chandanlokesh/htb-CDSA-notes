- 7 days exam
- 2 incident 
- Reports
- 17/20 flags
- refresh the exam panel before putting the flag
- if you dont find a flag skip or take break of 1-2 hr then come back
- whatever you need to pass right in the module
- you have to understand lik if theres spawn of `cmd.exe` form `notepad.exe` then you should know which place you have to look for have to find users, what event ID etc..

Discovery Metod:
```

- make sure about [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)
- stay organized with word space and naming conventions
- try to do reverse engg if you got any flag by luck
- BOTS are close to splunk
- make proper directories for reporting put if clean and clear notes
- not sure but sherlocks are not needed 
- need to do 2 report finish one then go to next then go on to next
- Master **Volatility** using the command line version; avoid relying on the GUI.
- Utilize [BTLO](https://blueteamlabs.online/home). For DFIR, I completed the following labs: [**SWIFT**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/swift-17217744e9)**,** [**Countdown**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigations)**,** [**Follow My Lead 1**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/follow-my-lead-0f448a5772). For Incident Response I recommend, [**SplunkIt**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/splunk-it-0aae63055a)**,** [**Midnite**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/midnite-175b216c1c)**, Cozy Bear and** [**Banker**](https://blueteamlabs.online/home/investigation/banker-c7964ff8ce).
- master volatility using command version not the GUI
