## SIEM Definition & Fundamentals

- **SIEM** (security information and event management) like security control room form computers and networks
- it collects **logs** form all systems and watches for suspicious activity and alerts security staff
- helps in collects logs, analyzes data, generates alerts, incident handling, reports and dashboards
- SIEM = SIM + SEM
- this is how it works (Collects Logs -> Normalize Data -> Correlate events (patterns matching)-> generate alerts -> security analysts investigate )

**SIEM for business requirements**
- Log aggregation and normalization
- threat alerting
- adding context to the logs
- compliance

## Introduction To The Elastic Stack

The **Elastic Stack** (also called the **ELK Stack**) is a set of open-source tools that work together to **collect, store, search, and visualize data**‚Äîespecially logs and events.

**components**
- **Elasticsearch**
	- its a search engine + database
	- it stores the logs an make them searchable
- **Logstash**
	- acts as the pipeline
	- transforms row unstructured data form different sources to structured that can be easily read by elasticsearch
	- the collected and transformed data is send to elasitchsearh
- **Kibana**
	- a dashboard & visualization tool
	- we can search, visualize and analyze the data
- **Beats**
	- lightweight agents installed on machines 
	- this will help to collect the logs form different sources form the end points like file, process, logon related data
	- the collected data is sent to logstash or elasticsearch

- kibana use its language for query (KQL)

syntax
```
field:value

example

event.code:4625
```

[KQL docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/query-filter/languages/kql)

**ECS is a standard set of field names** used in the Elastic Stack to make data **consistent**, **searchable**, and **correlatable** across all data sources.

> Think of ECS as a ‚Äúcommon language‚Äù that all logs (Windows, Linux, network, cloud, etc.) speak in Elastic.

`winlog.event_id:4625 AND winlog.event_data.SubStatus:0xC0000072`
we can use in ECS

`event.code:4625 AND winlog.event_data.SubStatus:0xC0000072`

## SIEM Use Case Development

### SIEM Use Case ‚Äì Overview

- SIEM use cases detect specific security events/behaviors.
    
- Range from simple (e.g., failed logins) to complex (e.g., ransomware outbreak).
    
- Example: 10 failed logins in 4 min ‚Üí correlated into ‚ÄúBrute Force‚Äù alert.
    

---

### Use Case Development Lifecycle

#### Requirements

- Define detection goal (e.g., brute force detection).
    
- Source: customer, analyst, internal request.
    
- Specify trigger conditions (e.g., 10 failures in 4 min).
    

#### Data Points

- Identify all login points (Windows, Linux, VPN, apps).
    
- Verify log sources capture user, timestamp, source, destination.
    

#### Log Validation

- Ensure logs include: user, timestamp, source, destination, hostname, app name.
    
- Test across all auth types: local, web, app, VPN, OWA.
    

#### Design & Implementation

- Define **Condition**, **Aggregation**, **Priority**.
    
- Example: 10 failures / 4 min ‚Üí aggregate per user ‚Üí MEDIUM priority.
    

#### Documentation (SOP)

- Include: conditions, aggregation, priorities, escalation matrix.
    

#### Onboarding

- Test in dev before prod.
    
- Tune to reduce false positives.
    

#### Periodic Update / Fine-Tuning

- Analyst feedback ‚Üí update rules.
    
- Maintain whitelist and refine logic.
    

---

### Use Case Build Guidelines

- Align with needs/risks.
    
- Map to **Kill Chain** / **MITRE ATT&CK**.
    
- Define **Time to Detect** (TTD) & **Time to Respond** (TTR).
    
- Maintain SOPs, Incident Response Plans (IRP).
    
- Set SLAs/OLAs for alert handling.
    
- Keep audit trail of alerts and response.
    
- Document logging coverage and rule triggers.
    
- Maintain a case management knowledge base.

### Example ‚Äì MSBuild Started by Office App (High Severity)

- **Risk**: Adversaries execute MSBuild via Word/Excel ‚Üí malicious payload.
    
- **Why**: LoLBins technique (Living-off-the-land binaries).
    
- **MITRE Mapping**:
    
    - Defense Evasion (TA0005) ‚Üí T1127, T1127.001
        
    - Execution (TA0002)
        
- **Priority**: HIGH (depends on environment).
    
- **Detection Fields**:
    
    - `process.name`
        
    - `process.parent.name`
        
    - `event.action`
        
    - machine name, user name, recent activity
        
- **SOP**: Investigate user machine, collect SIEM logs, AV logs, proxy logs.
    
- **False Positive Tuning**: Whitelist dev machines and known parent processes.
    

---

### Example ‚Äì MSBuild Making Network Connections (Medium Severity)

- **Risk**: MSBuild connects to remote IPs (possible C2).
    
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (legit MS IPs possible).
    
- **MITRE Mapping**: Execution (TA0002).
    
- **Detection Fields**:
    
    - `process.name = msbuild.exe`
        
    - `destination.ip` reputation check
        
- **Tuning**: Whitelist known MS update servers, dev systems.

## SIEM Visualization Example 3: Successful RDP Logon Related To Service Accounts


### Logic ‚Äì Successful RDP Logon with Service Accounts

**Goal**  
Detect successful RDP logons using service accounts (accounts starting with `svc-`).

**Why**

- Service accounts usually have high privileges.
    
- They should **never** be used for RDP in normal environments.
    
- Could indicate credential misuse or compromise.
    

**Key Event ID**

- `4624` ‚Üí Successful logon.
    

**Key Conditions**

- **LogonType** = `10` (RDP / RemoteInteractive).
    
- **user.name** starts with `svc-`.
    

**KQL Example**

```kql
event.code: 4624
AND winlog.logon.type: 10
AND user.name: "svc-*"
```

**Fields to Display**

- `user.name` ‚Üí Service account used.
    
- `host.hostname` ‚Üí Target machine.
    
- `source.ip` ‚Üí IP address of RDP connection.
    
- `@timestamp` ‚Üí Time of event.

## SIEM Visualization Example 4: Users Added Or Removed From A Local Group (Within A Specific Timeframe)


### Logic ‚Äì Users Added or Removed from Local Administrators Group (Specific Timeframe)

**Goal**  
Detect when users are **added to** or **removed from** the local ‚ÄúAdministrators‚Äù group within a defined time range.

**Why**

- Membership changes in the Administrators group can grant or revoke privileged access.
    
- Could indicate insider threat or account compromise.
    

**Key Event IDs**

- `4732` ‚Üí Member added to a security-enabled local group.
    
- `4733` ‚Üí Member removed from a security-enabled local group.
    

**Key Conditions**

- `group.name` = `"Administrators"`.
    
- `@timestamp` between `2023-03-05` and `now`.
    

**KQL Example**

```kql
(event.code: 4732 OR event.code: 4733)
AND group.name: "Administrators"
AND @timestamp >= "2023-03-05T00:00:00Z"
```

**Fields to Display**

- `winlog.event_data.MemberSid` ‚Üí User added/removed.
    
- `group.name` ‚Üí Group name (confirm ‚ÄúAdministrators‚Äù).
    
- `event.action` ‚Üí Addition or removal.
    
- `host.name` ‚Üí Machine where change occurred.
    
- `@timestamp` ‚Üí Time of event.

## The Triaging Process

### Alert Triaging ‚Äì SOC Analyst Workflow

**Definition**  
Process of reviewing, prioritizing, and escalating security alerts to determine threat level and impact.

---

### Steps

#### Initial Alert Review

- Check alert metadata: timestamp, source/destination IP, affected systems, triggering rule.
    
- Review related logs (network, system, application) for context.
    

#### Classification

- Rate **severity**, **impact**, and **urgency** per org policy.
    

#### Correlation

- Cross-check with related alerts/events/IOCs.
    
- Query SIEM for relevant data.
    
- Use threat intel feeds for known patterns/malware.
    

#### Enrichment

- Add data: packet captures, memory dumps, file samples.
    
- Use sandboxes, threat intel sources, OSINT.
    
- Check affected systems for anomalies (connections, processes, file changes).
    

#### Risk Assessment

- Impact on critical assets and sensitive data.
    
- Compliance/regulatory implications.
    
- Likelihood of lateral movement or further compromise.
    

#### Contextual Analysis

- Criticality of affected systems.
    
- Security controls in place and potential bypass/failures.
    
- Regulatory and contractual obligations affected.
    

#### Incident Response Planning

- Document all details and IOCs.
    
- Assign IR team roles.
    
- Coordinate with other departments/vendors.
    

#### IT Operations Consultation

- Gather missing context (system changes, maintenance, misconfigurations).
    
- Confirm if false positive or expected activity.
    

#### Response Execution

- If benign ‚Üí resolve and document.
    
- If suspicious ‚Üí initiate incident response actions.
    

#### Escalation

- Triggered by:
    
    - Critical asset compromise.
        
    - Ongoing/advanced attack.
        
    - Widespread impact.
        
    - Insider threats.
        
- Notify higher-level teams/management.
    
- Share alert summary, impact, enrichment, risk.
    
- Escalate externally if required (law enforcement, CERT).
    

#### Continuous Monitoring

- Track situation and IR progress.
    
- Keep communication open with escalated teams.
    

#### De-escalation

- Lower escalation level when incident is contained.
    
- Share summary of actions, outcomes, lessons learned.
    
- Update procedures to address gaps.
