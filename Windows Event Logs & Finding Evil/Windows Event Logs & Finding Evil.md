- Windows Event Logs are like **a diary your computer keeps**, recording almost everything that happens — from program errors to someone logging in.

**Main log categories:**
- **Application** → What apps have been up to (errors, crashes, start/stop events).
- **System** → Hardware, drivers, and Windows internals.
- **Security** → Logons, logoffs, privilege changes, file access attempts.
- **Setup** → Installation/configuration changes.
- **Forwarded Events** → Logs from other computers (centralized monitoring).

we can use **Event Viewer** or we can use **API** and **saved log files(.evtx)** into event viewer 

#### Anatomy of an event log

| `Field`           | `What it Means`                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Log Name**      | Which diary section this is from.                              |
| **Source**        | Who wrote it (software/app/service).                           |
| **Event ID**      | Unique code for the type of event.                             |

| **Level**         | Severity (Info, Warning, Error, Critical, Verbose).            |
| **Keywords**      | Tags to group events (e.g., "Audit Success", "Audit Failure"). |
| **User**          | Account that triggered the event.                              |
| **OpCode**        | The specific operation.                                        |
| **Logged**        | Date/time.                                                     |
| **Computer**      | Name of the machine.                                           |
| **XML Data**      | Raw detailed data.                                             |

#### 🖥️ **Windows System Logs**

|Event ID|Emoji|Name|Why it Matters|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1074**|📴|System Shutdown / Restart|Shows when & why system shut down/restarted — unexpected ones may be malicious.|
|**6005**|🟢|Event Log Service Started|Marks system boot — good start point for timeline analysis.|
|**6006**|🔴|Event Log Service Stopped|Often during shutdown — unexpected stops may hide activity.|
|**6013**|⏳|Windows Uptime|Shows daily uptime — short uptime could mean unwanted reboot.|
|**7040**|🔄|Service Startup Type Changed|Service changed from auto/manual — may indicate tampering.|

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250809115147.png)


- **LogonType** = `5` → This means **Service logon** (SYSTEM account started a service).
- **ProcessName** = `C:\Windows\System32\services.exe` → This is the process that triggered the logon.
- **SubjectLogonId** and **TargetLogonId** = `0x3e7` → This is important for correlation.

## Analyzing Evil With Sysmon & Event Logs

- **Sysmon** (_System Monitor_) is a **Windows system service** + **device driver** that    
    - Remains active across reboots.
    - Monitors & logs system activity to the **Windows Event Log**.
    - Helps with **deep monitoring** & **cyber forensic analysis**.
- **Purpose:** Provides detailed logs that the built-in Windows Security Log doesn’t record

**Sysmon Components**
1. windows service :runs in the background to monitor activity
2. device driver : assists in capturing system level data
3. event log : displays captured data in event viewer we can see that in 
`Applications and services logs > microsoft > windows > sysmon`

[full details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

#### **Sysmon configuration** 
its a xml configuration file where we can include what kind of logs we need to include and what kind of logs we need to exclude 

 **SwiftOnSecurity Sysmon Config** – [https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config)
 (Comprehensive, widely used in SOCs.)

**Olaf Hartong Sysmon Modular** – [https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular)  
(Modular approach – add only what you need.)

#### **Sysmon installation**

#### Detection Example 1: Detecting DLL Hijacking

- we will use event type 7 used to load ddl or images
- so we need to modify the `sysmonconfig-export.xml`
- we change include to exclude 
- remember like we dont want to include the rules to load images we exclude every thing and collect all the logs
- then load the image 

```shell
xfreerdp /u:Administrator /p:'HTB_@cad3my_lab_W1n10_r00t!@0' /v:ip /dynamic-resolution
```


#### Questions
Replicate the DLL hijacking attack described in this section and provide the SHA256 hash of the malicious WININET.dll as your answer. "C:\Tools\Sysmon" and "C:\Tools\Reflective DLLInjection" on the spawned target contain everything you need.

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250809194606.png)

With the modified Sysmon configuration, we can start observing image load events. To view these events, navigate to the Event Viewer and access "Applications and Services" -> "Microsoft" -> "Windows" -> "Sysmon."

[best blog that has DLL Hijacking ](https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/hijacking-dlls-in-windows)

if we see `calc.exe` 
![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250809195336.png)

[reflective DLL - a example that contain calc.exe and some dlls to test](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection/tree/master/bin).

we will take `calc.exe` and `WININET.dll` in the desktop folder and then we will run calc.exe it will load `WININET.dll` which is not in the windows core folder but which is in the desktop 
that dll contain a messabebox code that can be any malware 

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250809200809.png)

**Detection**

Event Viewer and access "Applications and Services" -> "Microsoft" -> "Windows" -> "Sysmon."

- add the filter event code 7

`idk why first i did not get the calc.exe and the win..dll so there was inject.exe and reflective_dll.dll so i use and done but i was not able to find the reflective_dll.dll with inject.exe`

`so idk i guess this is the right answer`

#### Detection Example 2: Detecting Unmanaged PowerShell/C-Sharp Injection

- C# is a managed language the code isnt executed directly by the cpu like odl-school c or assembly but run by a runtime environment deals with memory, security and garbage collector 
- the C# runtime is called as Common Language Runtime(CLR) a part of .net framework

##### how C# code will run
- .cs file 
- compiler (csc.exe) will convert the code to bytecode (intermediate language IL)
- if we run the bytecode loads IL which uses JIT compiler(just in time) this will we in the cpu instruction

##### why security folw
- Because C# needs the CLR, **malicious C# code also needs it** — if you can detect CLR activity in suspicious contexts, you might catch attacks like:
- **NET malware** (e.g., SharpHound, Covenant, PowerShell assemblies).    
    - **In-memory C# injection** (using `Assembly.Load` or reflective loading).
- This also means unusual loading of CLR DLLs (`clr.dll`, `mscorwks.dll`, `mscoree.dll`) in non-.NET processes can be a red flag.

in simple application that loads `CLR` that should be a `.NET` application if any application that is not .NET that is loading CLR that is bad

to detect C# injection we use  [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/).

```
The presence of "Microsoft .NET Runtime...", `clr.dll`, and `clrjit.dll` should attract our attention. These 2 DLLs are used when C# code is ran as part of the runtime to execute the bytecode.

Viewing modules shows `clr.dll and `clrjit.dll loaded — those are the .NET runtime DLLs.
```


#### powerhacker

| Color         | Meaning                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 🟩 Green      | Managed (.NET) process — uses CLR runtime   |
| 🟪 Purple     | Windows Service                             |
| 🟦 Light Blue | Immersive app (Windows Store / UWP)         |
| 🔵 Dark Blue  | Suspended process                           |
| ⚪ White       | Normal unmanaged process                    |
| ⚫ Grey        | Terminated process remnant (zombie process) |
normal processes is converted into green this is suspicious  

To showcase unmanaged PowerShell injection, we can inject an [unmanaged PowerShell-like DLL](https://github.com/leechristensen/UnmanagedPowerShell) into a random process, such as `spoolsv.exe`. We can do that by utilizing the [PSInject project](https://github.com/EmpireProject/PSInject) in the following manner.

#### Question

 Replicate the Unmanaged PowerShell attack described in this section and provide the SHA256 hash of clrjit.dll that spoolsv.exe will load as your answer. "C:\Tools\Sysmon" and "C:\Tools\PSInject" on the spawned target contain everything you need.

**steps of attack**
- `spoolsv.exe` – the print spooler service
- inject a malicious powershell engin into it 

```powershell
powershell -ep bypass
 Import-Module .\Invoke-PSInject.ps1
 Invoke-PSInject -ProcId [Process ID of spoolsv.exe] -PoshCode "V3JpdGUtSG9zdCAiSGVsbG8sIEd1cnU5OSEi"
```

- `-ep bypass`  This allows you to run scripts even if your system policy is set to block them.
- This **loads a PowerShell script** (`Invoke-PSInject.ps1`) into the current session. Takes PowerShell code and executes it _inside_ another process (not powershell.exe itself
- **`-ProcId`** → tells PSInject which process to inject into. Here, it’s the Process ID of `spoolsv.exe`
- **`-PoshCode`** → this is the actual PowerShell code to run.
- **The string `"V3JpdGUtSG9zdCAiSGVsbG8sIEd1cnU5OSEi"`** is **Base64 encoded**. if we encode it will be `write-Host "hello, guru99!"`


`C:\Tools\processhacker\x64` run the processhacker application

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250809214938.png)

see the color is changed and they are loaded the `clr.dll` and `cljt.dll` 

same we way we can detect using evnt id 7
8a3cd3cf2249e9971806b15c75a892e6a44cca5ff5ea5ca89fda951cd2c09aa9

#### Detection Example 3: Detecting Credential Dumping

- This **credential dumping** scenario is all about **stealing passwords directly from Windows memory**.
- **Target:** `lsass.exe` → This is a Windows system process that stores sensitive authentication info (password hashes, Kerberos tickets, etc.) in memory.
- **Tool Used:** **Mimikatz** → A very popular post-exploitation tool hackers use to read LSASS memory and extract credentials.

1. Attacker Gains Admin or SYSTEM Privileges
	1. Without elevated privileges, you can’t touch LSASS memory. `privilege::debug`
	2. This requests **SeDebugPrivilege** — a Windows permission that lets you debug or access other processes (like LSASS).
2. Attacker Reads LSASS Memory
	1. `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` connects to LSASS and dumps out any stored credentials.
	2. this will dump all the hashes
3. Attacker Uses Stolen Credentials

```
cd C:\Tools\Mimikatz
AgnetEXE
privilege::debug
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

#### How to Detect This

- sysmon event id 10 process access
- this tells us when one process tries to open another process's memory or handle.

#### question

Replicate the Credential Dumping attack described in this section and provide the NTLM hash of the Administrator user as your answer. "C:\Tools\Sysmon" and "C:\Tools\Mimikatz" on the spawned target contain everything you need.

### Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)

---

**What Is ETW?**
**Definition**:  
ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) is a high-speed, low-overhead tracing framework built into Windows OS that allows logging of detailed system and application events in real-time.
- Developed by Microsoft
- Works in both **user-mode** and **kernel-mode**
- Uses a **publish-subscribe model**

> **Think of ETW as a powerful microscope into the Windows OS internals** — capturing deep, real-time visibility of process, network, registry, and system behavior.

---

🔍 **Why ETW Matters in Security**
- Traditional logging (like Event Viewer) only scratches the surface.
- ETW gives **fine-grained**, **real-time**, and **low-noise** telemetry.
- It captures:
    - Process creation/termination
    - File access
    - Registry changes
    - Thread injections
    - DLL loads
    - Network connections
- Used by tools like **Sysmon**, **Windows Defender**, **WDAC**, **AMSI**, **ETW TI (Threat Intelligence)**.
---
**ETW Architecture & Components**

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250901235750.png)


  **Providers**
- Generate events.
- Examples: `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon`, `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process`, `Winlogon`, etc.
- Types:
    - **Manifest-based**
    - **MOF-based**
    - **WPP-based**   
    - **TraceLogging**

**Controllers**
- Start/Stop ETW sessions.
- Choose which providers and what level/keywords to log.
- Example tool: `logman.exe`

 **Consumers**
- Apps or services that **receive ETW data**.
- Examples: `eventvwr`, custom PowerShell scripts, SIEM agents, or custom tools.

 **Channels**
- Logical grouping of events (Admin, Operational, Debug, etc.)
- Only providers with a Channel property can be read in Event Viewer.

---

💡 How Does It Work?
- ETW operates via **Trace Sessions** (a kind of buffer).
- Controllers configure sessions.
- Providers write events to sessions.
- Consumers pull data from sessions or `.etl` (Event Trace Log) files.
---
 ⚒️ Interacting with ETW using `logman`
 
> `logman` = CLI tool to manage ETW sessions


#### Common Use Cases:

|Command|What it Does|
|---|---|
|`logman query -ets`|List all live ETW sessions|
|`logman query "SessionName" -ets`|View providers & details of a specific session|
|`logman query providers`|List all providers on system|
|`logman query providers <Name>`|View levels/keywords supported by a specific provider|
|`logman start myTrace -p <ProviderName>`|Start your own custom trace session|

Key Flags:

- `-ets` → required for querying **real-time/live** system-wide ETW sessions
- `findstr` → used to filter huge lists (`| findstr "Sysmon"`)

---

#### 📦 Sysmon & ETW

- **Sysmon** is an ETW provider (event source) and consumer (writes to Windows Event Logs).
- Events like **Event ID 10 (Process Access)** are sourced from ETW and need to be **enabled in the Sysmon config**.
- Using ETW directly lets you go **beyond what Sysmon collects**.

---

Notes & Tips
- ETW logs are often saved as `.etl` files for offline analysis.
- Use `Get-WinEvent` or custom tools to parse `.etl` logs.
- High-volume providers are **disabled by default** to prevent performance impact
- ETW is a **lightweight** and **real-time friendly** telemetry source.

---
#### GUI tool for ETW

**Performance Monitor**
- View active trace sessions.
- See providers attached to those sessions.
- Modify sessions by adding/removing providers.
- Create your own sessions (under **User Defined**).


**EtwExplorer**
- A third-party GUI tool to browse ETW providers and metadata.
- Helps in exploring what each provider supports (keywords, levels, GUIDs, etc.).


- **Providers** are components (from Windows or third-party apps) that **generate ETW events**.
- Each provider has:
    - A unique **name or GUID**.
    - Event **Levels** (Critical, Error, Warning, Info, Verbose).
    - **Keywords** to filter specific event types.
- Windows 10+ has over **1,000 built-in providers**.


#### 🔎 Useful ETW Providers for Security & Detection

|**Provider**|**Use Case**|
|---|---|
|`Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process`|Process injection, hollowing, suspicious execution|
|`Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-File`|File access, modification, ransomware activity|
|`Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Network`|C2 activity, unauthorized connections, data exfil|
|`Microsoft-Windows-SMBClient/Server`|Lateral movement, suspicious file shares|
|`Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime`|.NET exploitation, malicious .NET assemblies|
|`OpenSSH`|Brute force, SSH logins, failed/success attempts|
|`Microsoft-Windows-VPN-Client`|VPN activity (authorized/unauthorized access)|
|`Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell`|Suspicious script execution, script block logging|
|`Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Registry`|Registry changes (often used for persistence)|
|`Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity`|Malicious drivers, unsigned code loading|
|`Microsoft-Antimalware-Service`|Disabled AV, evasion of AV controls|
|`WinRM`|Remote command execution, lateral movement|
|`Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager`|Remote desktop connections|
|`Microsoft-Windows-Security-Mitigations`|Bypass of security controls (e.g., DEP, ASLR)|
|`Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client`|DNS tunneling, weird DNS queries|
|`Microsoft-Antimalware-Protection`|Protection status, evasion detection|

#### 🔐 Restricted Providers (Privileged Access Required)

Example: `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence`
- Only accessible by processes with **PPL (Protected Process Light)** rights.
- Used by **EDRs and AV tools** to get deep telemetry (e.g., Defender ATP).
- Cannot be accessed by normal tools or users (unless elevated via tricks or approved by Microsoft).
**Why it's restricted**: To prevent abuse by malware (since it has deep access to threat data).
To access it, a vendor must:
- Register with Microsoft.
- Implement **ELAM** driver (Early Launch Anti-Malware).
- Pass strict validation and sign with Microsoft-issued certificates.

```
sysmon is great but doesnt capture everything like some low level kernel events

logs are collected by .etl file
```

## Tapping into ETW

### Detection Example 1: Detecting Strange Parent-Child Relationships

its when a process is calling child process 
ex: calc.exe is spawning "cmd.exe"

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250902000352.png)

**Parent PID Spoofing** can be executed through the [psgetsystem project](https://github.com/decoder-it/psgetsystem) in the following manner.

```powershell
PS C:\Tools\psgetsystem> powershell -ep bypass

PS C:\Tools\psgetsystem> Import-Module .\psgetsys.ps1 

PS C:\Tools\psgetsystem> [MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent([Process ID of spoolsv.exe],"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe","")

```

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250902002403.png)

![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250902002729.png)



Due to the parent PID spoofing technique we employed, Sysmon Event 1 incorrectly displays `spoolsv.exe` as the parent of `cmd.exe`. However, it was actually `powershell.exe` that created `cmd.exe`.


 Let's begin by collecting data from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process` provider using [SilkETW](https://github.com/mandiant/SilkETW) (the provider can be identified using `logman` as we described previously, `logman.exe query providers | findstr "Process"`). After that, we can proceed to simulate the attack again to assess whether ETW can provide us with more accurate information regarding the execution of `cmd.exe`.

```powershell
c:\Tools\SilkETW_SilkService_v8\v8\SilkETW>SilkETW.exe -t user -pn Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process -ot file -p C:\windows\temp\etw.json

```




The `etw.json` file (that includes data from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process` provider) seems to contain information about `powershell.exe` being the one who created `cmd.exe`.

It should be noted that SilkETW event logs can be ingested and viewed by Windows Event Viewer through `SilkService` to provide us with deeper and more extensive visibility into the actions performed on a system.

### Detection Example 2: Detecting Malicious .NET Assembly Loading

1. **Background**

- **Living off the Land (LotL):** Attackers abuse legitimate built-in tools (e.g., PowerShell).
    
- **Bring Your Own Land (BYOL):** Attackers use **custom .NET assemblies** executed in memory (no disk writes).
    

 2. **Why .NET Assemblies Are Useful to Attackers**

- Pre-installed on all Windows systems.
    
- Managed by CLR → no need for manual memory management.
    
- Assemblies can be **loaded in memory** → fewer artifacts, bypasses file-based detections.
    
- Rich .NET libraries (HTTP, Crypto, IPC) = built-in attacker toolkit.
    
- Example: **CobaltStrike `execute-assembly`** → run .NET tools directly from memory.
    

3. **Detection Strategy (Sysmon)**

- Malicious .NET assemblies require loading **clr.dll** and **mscoree.dll**.
    
- Use **Sysmon Event ID 7 (Image Loaded)** to catch unusual DLL loads.
    
- Demo: Running `Seatbelt.exe` triggers these DLL loads.
    
- **Limitation:** Event ID 7 generates **huge volume of logs** and shows only _DLL load info_, not assembly details.

4. **ETW + SilkETW for Deeper Visibility**

- Use **ETW provider:** `Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime`.
    
- Collect with **SilkETW**:
    
    `SilkETW.exe -t user -pn Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime -uk 0x2038 -ot file -p C:\windows\temp\etw.json`
    
- Output (JSON) contains **detailed assembly info** (methods, JIT, loader).
    
![](../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250902193338.png)
**Selected ETW Keywords (`0x2038`):**

- **JitKeyword:** Tracks Just-In-Time compilation (methods executed).
    
- **InteropKeyword:** Managed ↔ unmanaged code interaction (API calls, native code).
    
- **LoaderKeyword:** Assembly loading details (which .NET assemblies load).
    
- **NGenKeyword:** Precompiled assemblies usage (detects NGen bypass tricks).

## Get-WinEvent

- [Get-WinEvent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/get-winevent?view=powershell-7.5&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7.3) tool that is used to see the logs in the powershell

```powershell
# list all the event logs are avilable 

Get-WinEvent -ListLog * | Select-Object LogName, RecordCount, IsClassicLog, IsEnabled, LogMode, LogType | Format-Table -AutoSize


# list the provider of the event
Get-WinEvent -ListProvider * | Format-Table -AutoSize


```


#### Retrieving events from the system log

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName 'System' -MaxEvents 50 | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

```

### Retrieving events from Microsoft-windows-WINRM/Operational

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational' -MaxEvents 30 | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

# to get the oldest event flag(switch)
-Oldest 
```

### Retrieving events from .evtx files

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -Path 'C:\Tools\chainsaw\EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES\Execution\exec_sysmon_1_lolbin_pcalua.evtx' -MaxEvents 5 | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

### Filtering events with FilterHashtable

```powershell
# we can write the condation what kind of data we need like a filter int he event viewer

Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=1,3} | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# filter the exported event file
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Path='C:\Tools\chainsaw\EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES\Execution\sysmon_mshta_sharpshooter_stageless_meterpreter.evtx'; ID=1,3} | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# sort acoridng to date
# use env variables 

$startDate = (Get-Date -Year 2023 -Month 5 -Day 28).Date
$endDate   = (Get-Date -Year 2023 -Month 6 -Day 3).Date
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=1,3; StartTime=$startDate; EndTime=$endDate} | Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message | Format-Table -AutoSize

```


### Filtering events with filterHashtable and XML

```powershell
#some suspicius activity happned in 52.113.194.132 ip
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=3} |
`ForEach-Object {
$xml = [xml]$_.ToXml()
$eventData = $xml.Event.EventData.Data
New-Object PSObject -Property @{
    SourceIP = $eventData | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "SourceIp"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
    DestinationIP = $eventData | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "DestinationIp"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
    ProcessGuid = $eventData | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "ProcessGuid"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
    ProcessId = $eventData | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "ProcessId"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '#text'
}
}  | Where-Object {$_.DestinationIP -eq "52.113.194.132"}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#`clr.dll` and `mscoree.dll` loading activity 
 $Query = @"
	<QueryList>
		<Query Id="0">
			<Select Path="Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational">*[System[(EventID=7)]] and *[EventData[Data='mscoree.dll']] or *[EventData[Data='clr.dll']]
			</Select>
		</Query>
	</QueryList>
	"@"

Get-WinEvent -FilterXml $Query | ForEach-Object {Write-Host $_.Message `n}

```

This script will retrieve all Sysmon network connection events (ID 3), parse the XML data for each event to retrieve specific details (source IP, destination IP, Process GUID, and Process ID), and filter the results to include only events where the destination IP matches the suspected IP.

### Filtering events with FilterXPath

its just combining the filter with xml

```powershell

# process creation

Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' `
-FilterXPath "*[EventData[Data[@Name='Image']='C:\Windows\System32\reg.exe']] 
and *[EventData[Data[@Name='CommandLine']='`"C:\Windows\system32\reg.exe`" ADD HKCU\Software\Sysinternals /v EulaAccepted /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f']]" `
| Select-Object TimeCreated, ID, ProviderName, LevelDisplayName, Message `
| Format-Table -AutoSize

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# network connections to a particular suspicious 52.113.194.132

Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' -FilterXPath "*[System[EventID=3] and EventData[Data[@Name='DestinationIp']='52.113.194.132']]"

```

### Filtering events based on property values

```powershell
# list all the property of sysmon 1 log
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=1} -MaxEvents 1 | Select-Object -Property *

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# process create event and parent commandline field 21 and "-enc" is the where the command is encrypted

Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational'; ID=1} `
| Where-Object {$_.Properties[21].Value -like "*-enc*"} `
| Format-List

```
