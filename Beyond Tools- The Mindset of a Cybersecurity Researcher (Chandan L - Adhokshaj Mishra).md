# Beyond Tools: The Mindset of a Cybersecurity Researcher

As part of the **CloudSEK Student Challenge – “Talk to a Cybersecurity Professional”**, I interviewed **Adhokshaj Mishra**, a Security Researcher at SentinelOne, hobbyist C++ programmer, and FOSS enthusiast.

The discussion was not about learning a specific tool or technical path. Instead, it focused on something deeper. The **mindset of a researcher**: discipline, motivation, mistakes to avoid, and the importance of passion. I believe this is the foundation. If we are willing to cultivate the right mindset, the skills and results will naturally follow. After all, we are not given the ability to dream of something we cannot achieve.

Here is the conversation in a Q&A format.

### **Q1. How did you first get started in cybersecurity? From where did you begin, and what kind of work are you doing today?**

**Adhokshaj Mishra:**  
After pre-university, I chose computer science engineering. In college, I got into C++ programming. Through friends, I came across someone who showed me malware written in C++. I was shocked and curious  _“Can we really write this in C++? Show me everything!”_ That intent to learn sparked my journey.

Soon, I was experimenting with advanced projects like toy kernels, yet ironically failing in OS classes. Eventually, I dropped out in my final year because I couldn’t focus. My parents were upset, but I began freelancing. Later, I took a malware course, and the subject that I once disliked became my area of research.

Over the years, I worked with firms like **Pyramid Cyber Security**, **EY**, **Uptycs**, **Quick Heal/Seqrite**, and now **SentinelOne**, focusing on Linux, MacOS, kernel security, and malware research. The key lesson: **never give up**. If something takes time, that’s okay passion and persistence always show intent.

### **Q2. What keeps you motivated to keep learning?**

**Adhokshaj Mishra:**  
There are days when I feel tired, stuck, or unable to grasp a concept. But two things help:

1. **Discipline** – Even when motivation fades, discipline keeps you consistent. Many students today lack this they don’t sit with focus. Discipline is everything.

2. **Breaks and Environment** – Sometimes, you need to take a break, go out, clear your head, and return fresh. Also, having a group that motivates and supports you is priceless.

In the end, I love what I do. That passion itself drives me forward.

### **Q3. Since everyone’s path is different, what path would you recommend for students or newcomers who want to build a career in cybersecurity?**

**Adhokshaj Mishra:**  
I won’t say, “Do SOC” or “Do VAPT ” Paths vary. What matters is how you choose to grow:

- **Linear Growth** – Put X effort, get X results. It’s predictable but shallow.
- **Exponential Growth** – Go deep into one thing, master it. Early progress feels slow, but over time the results are huge.

I chose exponential growth. It requires patience, but it compounds. So, don’t just chase quick results . **go deep, not just wide**.

### **Q4. What mistakes do you see students or beginners making these days?**

**Adhokshaj Mishra:**  
The biggest mistake is **ignoring the basics**. Many students rely on tools but don’t understand how they work. If a tool fails, they’re stuck. Fundamentals make you invisible and unshakable.

Another mistake: not reading books. Too many depend on notes or shortcuts. Books give depth and clarity.

Finally, students often lack consistency. If you sit, focus, and keep learning, soon you’ll start enjoying it. That’s when the brain goes into auto-pilot mode for growth.

### **Q5. With so many resources available, it feels overwhelming. How should students choose?**

**Adhokshaj Mishra:**  
I don’t mind if someone does many courses or earns multiple certificates. The main thing is depth. Whatever you pick, go deep and apply it in the real world. Only then will innovation happen.

---

### **Q6. Is it better to set strict goals or go with the flow?**

**Adhokshaj Mishra:**  
Goals are important, but don’t make them your prison. I focused on the **journey, not the end goal**. For me, the goal was simply to enjoy computers and life, not to buy a house or car.

Take the first step — that’s the hardest. As you keep going, your direction will become clearer. When I started, I never imagined I’d be here, but consistent steps shaped my path.

If you want to be a researcher, pursue it. If you want to be an entrepreneur, start small. Remember: small consistent steps build big things.

And once you grow, give back. I wouldn’t be here if others hadn’t shared their knowledge with me. That’s why I help others whenever I can.

## **Closing Thoughts**

This conversation was more about mindset than technology. From Mishra’s journey, a few truths stand out:

- **Never give up** — time spent learning is never wasted.
- **Discipline beats motivation** — consistency builds mastery.
- **Basics matter more than tools** — fundamentals are the real strength.
- **Focus on depth, not shortcuts** — exponential growth takes time but lasts.
- **Enjoy the journey** — goals evolve as you grow.

For students like me, this is powerful advice. Cybersecurity isn’t just about tools or certifications. It’s about discipline, passion, and belief that our dreams are within reach.
